          The goal of the Accelerator is to take students from knowing nothing
          about app development to a level where they can build and ship their
          own apps. They will pick a track from iOS, Android, or Backend
          development to learn about.

        <p style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
          We will also provide every mentee in the Accelerator program with
          close mentorship from an experienced mentor. They will receive career
          and academic guidance to help ensure they are successful in their
          journey at Rutgers and beyond.

          The RUMAD Incubator program is perfect for anyone who is looking to
          apply their iOS, Android, or Backend development skills in a
          structured manner. You will be working on a team to create a mobile
          app project. This project can be anything your team chooses. You are
          expected to contribute to the development of your project each week on
          your own time. In addition, you will have meetings with your mentor
          and other team members each week as well. These meetings will be
          approximately 1 hour long and can involve coding, delegating tasks, or
          debugging any issues which you could not fix on your own time during
          the week. The meetings will help keep you and your group on track to
          finishing the project.
